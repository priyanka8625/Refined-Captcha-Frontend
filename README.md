# Refined-Captcha-Frontend
This is the **frontend** for the bot detection system, built using **React**. It collects user interaction data (keystrokes, mouse movements, time on page) and sends it to the **Django backend** for analysis.

## Overview
This repository is a part of the project that introduces a robust CAPTCHA system designed for the UIDAI portal to differentiate between bots and human users. By leveraging passive environmental parameters and active interaction mechanisms, the solution ensures enhanced security while providing an optimized user experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Django
- **ML Model**: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Joblib
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Faker, Plotly
